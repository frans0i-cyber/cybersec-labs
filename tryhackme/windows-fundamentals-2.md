## Overview

This room delves deeper into Windows system administration and security, building upon the foundational knowledge from "Windows Fundamentals 1." It explores key tools and concepts for configuring, managing, and securing a Windows system. The room emphasizes tools accessible from MSConfig.

## Key Concepts

* **System Configuration (MSConfig):** In-depth look at the System Configuration utility (msconfig.exe), its various tabs (General, Boot, Services, Startup, Tools), and how it's used to troubleshoot startup issues, manage services, and configure boot options.
* **User Account Control (UAC) Settings:** Understanding how to modify UAC settings, the different levels of UAC, and the security implications of raising or lowering UAC.
* **Computer Management:** Exploring the Computer Management console (compmgmt.msc), its sections (System Tools, Storage, Services and Applications), and how it provides a centralized interface for managing various system components.
* **System Information (msinfo32):** Learning how to use the System Information tool to gather detailed information about the computer's hardware, software, and system configuration.
* **Resource Monitor (resmon.exe):** Understanding how to use Resource Monitor to track CPU, memory, disk, and network usage in real-time to identify performance bottlenecks.
* **Command Prompt (cmd.exe):** Further exploration of the Command Prompt, including essential commands for system administration, file management, and networking.
* **Registry Editor (regedit.exe):** Introduction to the Windows Registry, its hierarchical structure, how to navigate it, and how to modify registry keys and values (with appropriate warnings).
* **Tools Launchable from MSConfig:** Reinforcing that many of the tools covered in the room can be accessed through the Tools tab of MSConfig.

## Commands Used

* `msconfig`: Opens the System Configuration utility.
* `compmgmt.msc`: Opens the Computer Management console.
* `msinfo32`: Opens the System Information tool.
* `resmon`: Opens the Resource Monitor
* `cmd`: Opens the Command Prompt.
* `regedit`: Opens the Registry Editor.

## What I Learned

I expanded my knowledge of Windows system administration by exploring essential tools like System Configuration, Computer Management, and Resource Monitor. I learned how to use MSConfig to troubleshoot startup problems and manage system services. I also gained a deeper understanding of UAC settings and their impact on system security. The room provided insights into gathering system information using the System Information tool and monitoring system resources with Resource Monitor. Furthermore, I enhanced my command-line skills with Command Prompt and was introduced to the structure and function of the Windows Registry using the Registry Editor.
