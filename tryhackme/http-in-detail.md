## Overview
This room dives deep into the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the cornerstone of data exchange on the World Wide Web. It explores the fundamental principles governing how web browsers and servers communicate.

## Key Concepts
- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): The application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.
- HTTPS (HTTP Secure): The secure version of HTTP, ensuring encrypted communication.
- HTTP Requests: Messages sent by the client (e.g., web browser) to the server.
- HTTP Responses: Messages sent by the server back to the client.
- HTTP Methods: Verbs indicating the desired action (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- HTTP Status Codes: Three-digit codes indicating the outcome of a request (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).
- HTTP Headers: Key-value pairs providing additional information in requests and responses.
- Cookies: Small pieces of data stored by the browser to remember information about the user.
- Request-Response Cycle: The fundamental interaction pattern in HTTP communication.

## Commands Used
N/A (Likely a theory-based resource, but you can add relevant tools if your repo includes practical examples)

*(If your repo includes examples using `curl`, `requests`, browser developer tools, etc., list them here. For example:)*

> - `curl`: For making command-line HTTP requests.
> - `python -m http.server`: For setting up a simple HTTP server.
> - Browser Developer Tools (Network Tab): For inspecting HTTP traffic.

## What I Learned
I gained a comprehensive understanding of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, including its secure variant HTTPS. I learned about the structure of HTTP requests and responses, the purpose of various HTTP methods, and how status codes indicate the result of server-client interactions. The role and significance of HTTP headers in conveying additional information and how cookies are used for maintaining state and tracking were also clarified. This resource provides a solid foundation for understanding how web applications communicate.
