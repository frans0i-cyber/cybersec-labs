## Overview

This section covers additional components that enhance website functionality and efficiency, along with a detailed breakdown of how web servers operate.

## Key Concepts

* **Load Balancers:** Distribute network traffic across multiple servers to optimize resource utilization, maximize throughput, reduce response time, and avoid overloading any single server.
* **CDN (Content Delivery Network):** A geographically distributed network of servers that caches static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, videos) to deliver it to users based on their location, reducing latency and improving load times.
* **Databases:** Store and manage website data, such as user information, product catalogs, and dynamic content. Different types of databases exist, including relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB).
* **WAF (Web Application Firewall):** A security device or software that protects web applications by filtering, monitoring, and blocking malicious HTTP traffic. It helps prevent attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and DDoS.
* **Web Server:** A computer system that processes requests via HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS. It delivers web pages and other content to clients, such as web browsers.
* **Virtual Hosts:** A feature that allows a single web server to host multiple websites with their own domain names (or hostnames).
* **Static vs Dynamic Content:**
    * **Static Content:** Web content that remains the same for all users and is served directly from stored files (e.g., HTML, CSS, images).
    * **Dynamic Content:** Web content that is generated on the fly by the web server in response to a user's request.
* **Scripting and Backend Languages:** Programming languages used on the server-side to handle logic and generate dynamic content (e.g., Python, PHP, Node.js).

## Commands Used

*(This section is likely theory-based. If there are any specific commands or tools demonstrated in the room, please add them here. For example, if the room discusses server configuration, you might include examples of commands used to configure Apache or Nginx.)*

## What I Learned
I learned about the different components that contribute to a website's infrastructure, including load balancers, CDNs, databases, and WAFs. I also gained a deeper understanding of how web servers function, including the concepts of virtual hosts, static vs. dynamic content, and the role of backend scripting languages.
