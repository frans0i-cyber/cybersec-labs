## Overview
This room introduces the fundamental concepts of packets and frames, which are the building blocks of network communication. It likely covers how data is encapsulated and transmitted across networks.

## Key Concepts
- Packets: The basic unit of data transfer in TCP/IP networks.
- Frames: The basic unit of data transfer in a local area network (LAN), typically at the data link layer.
- Encapsulation: The process of adding headers and trailers to data as it moves down the network layers.
- De-encapsulation: The reverse process of removing headers and trailers as data moves up the network layers.
- MAC Addresses: Physical addresses used at the data link layer for communication within a LAN.
- IP Addresses: Logical addresses used at the network layer for communication across networks.
- The OSI Model (potentially referenced): Understanding the different layers and where packets and frames operate.
- Ethernet: A common networking technology for LANs and the context for many frame discussions.

## Commands Used

## What I Learned
I learned the distinction between packets and frames and their respective roles in network communication. I now understand the process of encapsulation and de-encapsulation and how headers and trailers are added at different layers. The importance of MAC addresses for local communication and IP addresses for broader network communication was also clarified. This room provided a foundational understanding of how data is structured for transmission across networks.
