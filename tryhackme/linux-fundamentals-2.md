## Overview

This room is the second part of the "Linux Fundamentals" series, building upon the knowledge gained in Part 1. It focuses on expanding your command-line skills, introducing flags and switches, advancing filesystem interaction, understanding file permissions, exploring common Linux directories, and establishing remote access using SSH. This room aims to equip you with fundamental skills for navigating and managing Linux systems.

## Key Concepts

* **Accessing Your Linux Machine Using SSH (Deploy):**
    * **Secure Shell (SSH):** A protocol for secure remote command-line access. Use `ssh tryhackme@<target_machine_ip>` with the provided IP and password `tryhackme`.
* **Introduction to Flags and Switches:**
    * **Modifying Command Behavior:** Flags (options) alter command defaults.
    * **`ls` Example:**
        * `ls`: Lists directory contents (excluding hidden).
        * `ls -a` or `ls --all`: Lists all files, including hidden.
        * `ls --help`: Shows help for `ls`.
    * **`man` command:** Displays the manual page for commands (e.g., `man ls`).
* **Filesystem Interaction Continued:** Expanding file and directory manipulation (e.g., `mkdir`, `rm`).
* **Permissions 101:** Understanding Linux file permissions (read, write, execute).
* **Common Directories:** Exploring key Linux directories (`/`, `/home`, `/etc`, etc.).
* **Conclusions & Summaries:** Reviewing learned concepts and commands.

## Commands Used

* `ssh`: Secure Shell client for remote access.
* `ls`: List directory contents.
    * `-a` or `--all`: Show hidden files.
    * `--help`: Display command help.
* `man ls`: Display manual page for `ls`.
* `mkdir`: Create directories.
* `rm`: Remove files/directories.
* `chmod`: Change permissions.
* `cd`: Change directory.
