## Overview

This room serves as an introduction to the fundamental concepts and commands of the Linux operating system. It aims to provide a hands-on experience with the Linux command line and file system, making it suitable for beginners looking to build a solid foundation in Linux.

## Key Concepts

* **Understanding why Linux is so commonplace today:** Exploring the reasons for Linux's popularity and widespread use in various industries and applications.
* **Interacting with your first-ever Linux machine!:** Providing a direct, in-browser Linux terminal for users to interact with the command line without any local setup.
* **Running some of the most fundamental commands:** Introducing essential Linux commands for basic navigation, information retrieval, and interaction with the system. Examples include `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `whoami`, `date`, `echo`.
* **Had an introduction to navigating around the filesystem & how we can use commands like find and grep to make finding data even more efficient!:** Understanding the hierarchical structure of the Linux filesystem, navigating through directories, and using `find` and `grep` for efficient file searching.
* **Power up your commands by learning about some of the important shell operators:** Understanding how to use shell operators to chain commands, redirect input and output, and perform more complex operations on the command line. Examples include `>`, `>>`, `<`, `|`, `&&`, `||`.
* **Linux Fundamentals Part 2:** *(This indicates a continuation of the learning.)*

## Commands Used

* `pwd`: Print working directory - shows the current directory you are in.
* `ls`: List directory contents - displays files and directories in the current location.
* `cd`: Change directory - allows you to navigate the filesystem.
* `whoami`: Print current user name - shows the username of the currently logged-in user.
* `date`: Display the current date and time.
* `echo`: Display a line of text/string.
* `find`: A powerful tool for searching for files and directories based on various criteria.
* `grep`: A command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines matching a regular expression.
* `>`: Output redirection - redirects the output of a command to a file, overwriting the file if it exists.
* `>>`: Append output redirection - appends the output of a command to a file.
* `<`: Input redirection - redirects the input of a command from a file.
* `|`: Pipe - sends the output of one command as the input to another command.
* `&&`: Logical AND - executes the second command only if the first command succeeds.
* `||`: Logical OR - executes the second command only if the first command fails.

## What I Learned

I gained a foundational understanding of the Linux operating system and the reasons for its widespread adoption. I learned how to interact with a Linux machine through the command line using fundamental commands for navigation and information retrieval. I also explored the Linux filesystem structure and how to efficiently search for files using `find` and `grep`. Furthermore, I grasped the power of shell operators in combining and manipulating commands for more effective command-line usage. This room provided a crucial first step in my Linux journey.
