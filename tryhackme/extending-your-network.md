## Overview
Explores various technologies and motivations behind extending networks beyond the local environment and onto the internet.

## Key Concepts
- **Port Forwarding:** The process of redirecting communication requests from one IP address and port number combination to another while the packets are traversing a network gateway, such as a router or firewall. This allows external devices to access services on a private network.
- **Firewalls:** Security systems that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. They act as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet.
- **VPN Basics:** Virtual Private Networks create a secure and encrypted connection over a less secure network, like the internet. This allows users to extend a private network across public networks, maintaining privacy and security.
- **LAN Networking Devices:** Hardware components that facilitate communication and connectivity within a Local Area Network (LAN). These include devices like switches, hubs (less common now), and wireless access points. Understanding them is crucial for extending the local network effectively.
- **Network Simulation:** The process of modeling network behavior in a virtual environment. This allows for testing, learning, and experimentation with network configurations and scenarios without impacting a live network.

## What I Learned
This room introduced different methods for connecting networks and the reasons for doing so. I gained a foundational understanding of how port forwarding allows external access, how firewalls protect networks, the basics of establishing secure remote connections with VPNs, the role of LAN devices in network expansion, and the value of network simulators for practical learning.
