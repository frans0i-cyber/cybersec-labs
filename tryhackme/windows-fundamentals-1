## Overview

This room introduces the fundamental aspects of the Windows operating system, providing a groundwork for understanding its different editions, user interface, file system, core system folders, user account management, security features, system settings, and process management.

## Key Concepts

* **Introduction to Windows:** A general overview of the Windows operating system, its history, and its significance in the computing landscape.
* **Windows Editions:** Exploring the various editions of Windows (e.g., Home, Pro, Enterprise) and their key differences in features and target users.

## Commands Used

*(This room is likely more GUI-focused, but if any command-line tools are introduced, list them here. For example, if they touch on Command Prompt or PowerShell for certain tasks, you could include them.)*

* `explorer.exe`: (Potentially mentioned as the process for File Explorer/Desktop)
* `taskmgr.exe`: (The executable for Task Manager)
* `control`: (Command to open the Control Panel)
* `ms-settings:`: (URI scheme to open the Settings app)

*(As you progress, note any specific command-line tools or executables discussed.)*

## What I Learned

I gained a foundational understanding of the Windows operating system, including its various editions and their intended uses. I learned about the key elements of the Windows desktop GUI and how users interact with it. The organization of the Windows file system (NTFS) and the significance of drive letters and folders were clarified. I also explored the critical `Windows\System32` directory and its role in the operating system's functionality. Furthermore, I learned about user account management, profiles, and how permissions control access to resources. The purpose and function of User Account Control (UAC) as a security mechanism were also explained. Finally, I became familiar with the tools for configuring system settings (Settings and Control Panel) and the Task Manager for monitoring and managing system processes.
