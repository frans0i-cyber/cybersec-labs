## Overview
This room provides a foundational understanding of how websites function, covering the essential technologies and processes involved in delivering web content to users.

## Key Concepts
- How Websites Work: The fundamental steps involved when a user requests a webpage, from the browser's request to the server's response.
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The standard markup language for creating web pages, defining the structure and content.
- JavaScript: A scripting language that enables dynamic and interactive elements on websites.
- Sensitive Data Exposure: Understanding common vulnerabilities that can lead to the unintentional disclosure of sensitive information.
- HTML Injection: A type of security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious HTML code into a webpage.

## Commands Used
- Browser's "View Source" functionality: To inspect the underlying HTML of a webpage.
- HTML Injection Examples:
    - `<a href="http://hacker.com">http://hacker.com</a>`:  Injects a hyperlink to an external site.
    - `<img src="dog-1.png">`:  Embeds an image from a specified source.

## What I Learned
I gained a clear understanding of the end-to-end process of how websites work, from the initial request to the rendering of the webpage in the browser. I learned about the core role of HTML in structuring web content and how JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior. The room also highlighted the critical security concern of sensitive data exposure and introduced HTML injection as a common web vulnerability. This knowledge provides a solid base for further exploration into web development and security.
