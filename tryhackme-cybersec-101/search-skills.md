# Cybersecurity 101: Sharpen Your Search Skills

## Overview
This room introduces fundamental search techniques and essential online resources crucial for cybersecurity professionals. It emphasizes the importance of efficient information retrieval for understanding threats, analyzing vulnerabilities, and conducting incident response. You'll learn how to leverage search engines effectively and critically evaluate the information you find.

## Key Concepts
- **Search Operators:** Special commands used with search engines (like `site:`, `filetype:`, `intitle:`) to refine search queries and obtain more targeted results.
- **Cybersecurity Resources:** Key online platforms and databases (such as CVE databases, security news websites, and vendor advisories) that provide valuable cybersecurity information.
- **Effective Query Formulation:** The process of constructing precise and specific search terms and using boolean logic to maximize the relevance of search results.
- **Information Evaluation:** The critical assessment of the reliability, relevance, and potential bias of information obtained from various online sources.
- **OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence):** The practice of collecting and analyzing publicly available information, where strong search skills are foundational.

## What I Learned
This room provided a foundational understanding of how to effectively search for cybersecurity-related information. I learned how to utilize various search engine operators to narrow down results, identify key online resources for security knowledge, formulate more effective search queries, and critically evaluate the information I find to ensure its reliability and relevance in the context of cybersecurity tasks and research.
