# WinADBasics

## Overview
This room introduces the basic concepts and functionality provided by Active Directory (AD), a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. AD is a centralized and hierarchical database that stores information about network resources and the configuration of the network. This room will help you become comfortable using essential Windows features (in a safe environment), including user account permissions, resource management and monitoring, registry access, and security controls.

## Key Concepts
- **Active Directory (AD):** A directory service that authenticates and authorizes users and computers in a Windows domain network.
- **Domain Controller:** The server in charge of running the Active Directory services.
- **Organizational Units (OUs):** Containers used to group users and computers for consistent policy application.
- **Group Policy Objects (GPOs):** Collections of settings used to apply policies to OUs.
- **Kerberos:** An authentication protocol used by Active Directory.
- **SYSVOL:** A shared directory on domain controllers that stores GPOs.

## What I Learned
This room provides a foundational understanding of Active Directory, including its role in managing users, computers, and resources within a Windows domain. I learned about key components like Domain Controllers, Organizational Units, and Group Policies. I also gained insights into authentication methods used in AD.
