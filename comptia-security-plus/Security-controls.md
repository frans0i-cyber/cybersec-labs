## 📘 Lesson 1: Security Controls — CompTIA Security+ (Professor Messer)

This lesson introduces the foundational concept of **Security Controls**, which are mechanisms put in place to reduce or mitigate security risks. Understanding these control types is crucial for building a secure environment and is a key topic in the CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) exam.

### 🔐 What Are Security Controls?
Security controls are safeguards or countermeasures to detect, prevent, or mitigate security risks to physical property, information, computer systems, or other assets.

### 🛡️ Categories of Security Controls:

1. **Managerial Controls**
   - Focus on policies and procedures.
   - Examples: Risk assessments, security policies, personnel screening.

2. **Operational Controls**
   - Day-to-day procedures and mechanisms to ensure security.
   - Examples: Incident response processes, awareness training, physical access controls.

3. **Technical Controls (Logical Controls)**
   - Technology-based mechanisms to protect systems and data.
   - Examples: Firewalls, antivirus software, access control lists (ACLs), encryption.

### 🧭 Control Types by Purpose:

| Control Type  | Description                          | Example                             |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Preventive** | Stop incidents before they occur     | Locks, firewalls                    |
| **Detective**  | Identify and record incidents        | CCTV, intrusion detection systems   |
| **Corrective** | Fix or recover from an incident      | Backups, patching systems           |
| **Deterrent**  | Discourage attackers from acting     | Warning signs, guard presence       |
| **Compensating** | Alternative controls when primary ones aren’t feasible | Manual procedures, extra checks     |

### 📌 Key Takeaways:
- Controls are layered and should be used in combination (defense in depth).
- Understand both **what** a control does and **why** it's in place.
- Know how to classify controls in **exam scenarios** and real-life applications.
