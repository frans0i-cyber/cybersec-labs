## CompTIA Security+ Overview

I'm currently preparing for the **CompTIA Security+** certification using resources from [Professor Messer](https://www.professormesser.com/), a well-known and trusted source for free IT training.

Security+ is a globally recognized certification that validates essential cybersecurity knowledge and skills. It focuses on practical security problem-solving and is often considered the first step for those entering the cybersecurity field.

- **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** – Security policies, regulations, risk management, and frameworks.

This certification supports career roles such as:
- Security Analyst
